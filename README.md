# midi to bitsy
there should be 16 notes in a bar you can make 1 note as long as an entire bar. if your midi file is polyphonic notes would be deleted from it to make it monophonic. add a main melody to get data or add another midi file to bass/counter melody to get both data. When you display the data, go to bitsy and create a new tune and right under TUNE (a number or letter) paste the data under it then in bitsy you can change the name/tempo/pusle waves 
the maximum number of bars in bitsy currently is 16 
look at the demonstration midi as an example of what you can do. make sure you dont make long notes pass over from one bar into another bar

in logic or any other program that doesnt quantize note lengths you should edit the length manually so that the order doesnt get messed up in bitsy.
